  <p><b>What purposes can an essay have?</b></p> 
  <ul type=disc> 
    <li>Describe an idea/concept/area so that the reader understands the message the writer is trying to get across.</li> 
    <li>Describe an idea/concept/area so that the reader understands that the writer (e.g. a student!) understands the message the writer is trying to get across.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>So sometimes your reader may know more than you about the topic, sometimes less. In either case, <i>clear writing</i> and <i>an organised structure</i> are essential.</p> 
  <p><b>The topic and the title.</b></p> 
  <ul type=disc> 
    <li>Consider only one issue – be clear about what your subject area is.</li> 
    <li>Choose a precise title that makes it clear what your subject is.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>Making a plan.</b></p> 
  <ul type=disc> 
    <li>Important function of the plan: <i>forces you to (a) think and (b) then organise your thoughts.</i></li> 
    <li>Try sketching out a summary. What’s the purpose of your essay? What arguments are you going to use to make your points? What is your conclusion?</li> 
    <li>Try sketching out an outline.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul type=disc> 
    <ul type=circle> 
      <li>Write out a series of headings and subheadings – this will help you to achieve a logical structure.</li> 
      <li>If these headings are questions, you can perhaps develop the outline into the essay by answering these questions.</li> 
      <li>Study your headings critically.</li> 
      <ul type=square> 
        <li>Are they all relevant?</li> 
        <li>Do they follow on from each other sensibly?</li> 
        <li>Are some unnecessary sidetracks?</li> 
        <li>Have you missed something important?</li> 
        <li>Are there some things included that you don’t understand? If so, you may need to plug the gap.</li> 
      </ul> 
    </ul> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>Writing the essay.</b></p> 
  <ul type=disc> 
    <li><b>Don’t <span class=GramE>start</span> until you are sure your outline is complete and that you understand everything!</b></li> 
    <li>If you can write a first (even rough) draft in a single sitting, there’s more chance that you will produce something coherent. You can always polish later.</li> 
    <li>Leave it for a while and do something else before you have a look again at what you have drafted – this will allow you to get some useful distance from what you have written before coming at it again. </li> 
    <li>When you do look at it again, ask yourself questions such as:</li> 
    <ul type=circle> 
      <li>Are your arguments clear?</li> 
      <li>Is your conclusion sound?</li> 
      <li>Is there something missing?</li> 
      <li>Is some of your material superfluous?</li> 
    </ul> 
    <li>Rewrite as necessary. You may need to do several rewrites before you feel you have got it right. And the more thinking you can do between drafts (in my case I’m sure a lot of this is unconscious thinking) the more likely you are to produce a clear, well-argued essay.</li> 
  </ul>
