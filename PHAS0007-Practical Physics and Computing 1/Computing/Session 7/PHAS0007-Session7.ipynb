A real crystal is finite, rather than extending to infinity in each direction, and will also have surface effects as well as defects and/or interfaces, which are fascinating topics in research, for example at the LCN: https://www.london-nano.com/research/themes/thin-films-surfaces-and-interfaces)\n",
