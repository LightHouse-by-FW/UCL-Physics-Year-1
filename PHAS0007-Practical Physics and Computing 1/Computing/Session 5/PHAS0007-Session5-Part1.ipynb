Before we can implement this in Python, we need to understand the underlying maths - this is also covered in Dr Bartlett's Data Analysis lectures, so this should be a review of stuff you've already met.\n",

    "A straight line has the equation\n",

    " $$y = mx + c$$\n",

This is an updated version of the visualisation you saw in the screencast.\n",
