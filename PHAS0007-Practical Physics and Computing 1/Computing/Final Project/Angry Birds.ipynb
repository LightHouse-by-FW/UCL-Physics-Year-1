    "# An Angry Birds adaptation in Python using VPython: 18018699\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Jupiter notebook we have used the Numpy and VPython libraries in order to create a game resembling the same mechanics as that of \"Angry Birds\". In the following notebook we begin by setting up our \"scene\" environment and \"ground\", which are going to be constant in all instances of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the game we will have our bird as being a Python ball object and our target as being a VPython cuboid object. We will then use the function \"random()\" in order to create a new and different environment for each time the game is loaded into a new instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of the game is going to be to first input an initial speed and launch angle with the aim of hitting the target and causing it to topple over. If these initial parameters inputed by the user lead to the target not toppling over, due to the force from the bird not being large enough or the bird simply missing the target, then the game will restart in a new instance so that the user can have another chance of toppling the target\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this aim we will begin by defining some of the parameters of both our target and our bird, this includes things like the mass and parameters relating to the animation of the objects in our VPython scene. We will then define a function which will run a new instance of the game eveytime it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance begins by setting new parameters using the \"random()\" function, which create new and original enviorments. Once those parameters are set the game will then ask for the user to input their initial velocity and angle of launch. Using the values inuted by the user, the program will then use a while fucntion to run the animation of the bird and calculate the path of the bird. Using the calcultions of the path the function will then use an if statement to test it the ball has hit the target. If the ball has hit the target we then refer to a nested if statement to test if this collision would cause the target to topple. If it does cause the target to topple, tha target will then be subject to rotate 90 degrees clockwise about the the bottom right corner. If it doesn't cause the target to topple or does not even hit the target this will lead to the program creating a new instance for the player to try again until they win a game."

    "In the case of this game we have assumed that if the bird hits the target that all of the momentum is transfered to the target as well as the the collision being completely elastic. This is not an accurate representation of a real world scenario since most collisions are not totally elastic but rather inelastic. We have also excluded the fact that in a real world scenario most bodies travelling through air will have their path significantly effected by the air resistance.\n",

    "We have also not accurately animated the toppling of the target itself. We have instead simply forced the target to rotate once the applied torque exceeds the restoring torque. This does not accurately show how this would happen in the real world, with the speed at which the target topples being dependent on how much the restoring torque was exceeded. We have also not animated the case in which the restoring torque exceeds the applied torque as the target begins to rotate slightly and then goes back to it's original position.\n",

    "Implementing the air resistance would come from using the fact that their is a force $ F_{air} = -\\beta v $. This force is directly in opposition to the motion of the bird. By using an accepted value of $ \\beta $ and then taking horizonatal and vertical components of the force we can then accodunt for this force. Dividing the force by the mass of the bird to get acceleration terms which will then be used in the calculations of the velocity, and also position of the ball $ a_{air} = \\frac{-\\beta v}{m_{bird}} $.\n",

    "The toppling can be accounted for by using the rotate function in itterations inside of a while loop after having calculeted the time taken for the target to topple ."
